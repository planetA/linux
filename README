Linux kernel
============

Fastcall
--------

The fastcall architecture is implemented in arch/x86/fastcall .
An example driver is located at drivers/fastcall-examples .
You can view Documentation/fastcall/Architecture.md for an architectural
overview.
Have a look at Documentation/fastcall/Template.md before creating a new
driver.

General
-------

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
